## üîÅ **What is Client-Server Architecture?**

The **client-server model** is a **communication pattern** in which:

* A **client** requests a service (like loading a webpage).
* A **server** provides that service (like sending HTML, CSS, JS files).

---

## üíª CLIENT

The **client** is:

* **Any device** or **software** that sends a request for information or a service to a server.
* Examples:

  * A browser (like Chrome) requesting a webpage.
  * An email app checking your inbox.
  * A mobile app making an API call to a backend.

### ‚úÖ Key Points:

* It **initiates the connection**.
* Waits for a **response** from the server.
* **Does not need to store data** or handle logic (usually).

---

## üñ•Ô∏è SERVER

A **server** can refer to two things:

### 1. üß± **Hardware Server** (Physical or Virtual Machine)

* A powerful computer (in data centers or cloud) that runs software to serve requests.
* Has CPU, memory, storage, IP address, and often runs 24/7.

### 2. üß† **Software Server** (Running on the hardware)

* A program that listens for and handles client requests.
* Examples:

  * **HTTP Server** (like Apache, Nginx, Node.js server)
  * **FTP Server** (for file transfers)
  * **SMTP Server** (for sending emails)
  * **Database Server** (like MySQL, MongoDB)

## üåê HOW A CLIENT CONNECTS TO A SERVER (Step-by-Step)

When you type `chat.openai.com` in your browser:

### 1. **DNS Resolution**

* Your browser sends a request to a **DNS server** to translate `chat.openai.com` into an **IP address** (e.g., `104.22.9.123`).

### 2. **TCP/IP Connection**

* Your browser establishes a connection to that IP address using a protocol like **TCP**.
* A **port number** is used to direct the request to the right service on that server (default for HTTP is port `80`, HTTPS is `443`).

### 3. **Handshake**

* For secure websites (HTTPS), a **TLS handshake** happens to secure the connection.

### 4. **HTTP Request**

* The browser (client) sends an **HTTP GET request** for the page.
* The **web server** (e.g., running Nginx or Node.js) receives it and processes it.

### 5. **Server Response**

* The server sends back an **HTTP Response** (HTML, CSS, JS files, or JSON data).
* Your browser renders it.

### 6. **Closing or Keeping Alive**

* The connection can be **closed** or **kept alive** for future requests.

## üîå Ports & Multiple Services

Each server (machine) can run **multiple software servers** on different **ports**:

| Protocol             | Port Number      | Purpose                      |
| -------------------- | ---------------- | ---------------------------- |
| HTTP                 | 80               | Web (unsecured)              |
| HTTPS                | 443              | Web (secured)                |
| FTP                  | 21               | File transfer                |
| SSH                  | 22               | Secure shell (remote access) |
| SMTP                 | 25               | Email sending                |
| Custom App (Node.js) | 3000, 8000, etc. | Your custom backend          |

## üîÅ What is a "Socket"?

A **socket** is the combination of:

* IP Address
* Port Number

It uniquely identifies a **connection** between a client and a server.

E.g.,
Client socket: `192.168.1.5:50001`
Server socket: `104.22.9.123:443`
This pair forms a **TCP connection**.

## ü§ñ Where does ChatGPT fit in?

When you use ChatGPT:

1. Your browser (client) hits a **load balancer** at OpenAI's servers.
2. This forwards your request to a **server** running OpenAI's API/service.
3. The **backend server** processes your input, runs the model, and returns a **response**.
4. That data is sent back through the **HTTP response**, rendered in your browser.

## ‚úÖ Summary Table

| Term                | Description                               |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| **Client**          | Sends request (Browser, app)              |
| **Server**          | Responds with data/service                |
| **Hardware Server** | Machine running server software           |
| **Software Server** | Program like HTTP, FTP, SMTP server       |
| **IP Address**      | Unique address of a machine               |
| **Port**            | Identifies the specific service           |
| **Socket**          | IP + Port = Unique communication endpoint |
| **DNS**             | Translates domain names to IP addresses   |
| **Protocol**        | Rules of communication (HTTP, FTP, etc.)  |
