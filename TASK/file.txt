The sun dipped below the horizon, casting a warm, orange glow across the sky.
Birds chirped their evening songs, preparing for the night.
A gentle breeze rustled through the leaves of the trees.
A lone wolf howled in the distance, its call echoing through the valley.
The first stars began to twinkle, marking the arrival of night.
